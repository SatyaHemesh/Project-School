## 🧠 Prime Number Logic (Python)

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
````

This function checks up to the square root of the number, making it efficient for large inputs.
